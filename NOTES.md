## Some Decisions:

#I decided to use pure CSS to demonstrate my ability to build components from scratch. While I have used Bootstrap multiple times, I thought it would be better to showcase my skills with pure CSS in this case.

#I used Google Fonts and Font Awesome for icons. However, some icons were premium, so I extracted those from Figma when necessary.

# I utilized CSS root variables for color management and set the base rem value to equal 10px for easier conversion. For example, if a font size is 63px in Figma, dividing it by 16 to convert to rem can be time-consuming. Setting the rem to 10px allows for quick conversionâ€”63px becomes 6.3rem directly.

# I also handled the tab sliding effect for the user profile section using Vanilla JavaScript instead of relying on jQuery.
